# University Management System - Complete AI-Ready Development Plan
---

## ðŸŽ¯ CONTEXT

You are implementing a **University Management Layer** for ELIRA e-learning platform. This is a **B2B component** that allows universities to manage their own instructors, courses, and students within the existing B2C platform.

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Complete data isolation between universities
- **Approval workflow**: University instructors create courses â†’ University admins approve â†’ Public visibility
- **Role-based dashboards**: Different interfaces for university admins vs instructors
- **Analytics system**: University-scoped metrics and insights
- **Permission boundaries**: Strict access control with no data leakage

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Firebase Firestore, Cloud Functions, Tailwind CSS
**Rule:** NO PLACEHOLDERS - only complete, working implementations

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS

### **Code Quality Requirements:**
```typescript
// ALWAYS follow these patterns for university management:

// 1. University-scoped queries MUST include universityId filter
const getUniversityCourses = async (universityId: string) => {
  return firestore
    .collection('courses')
    .where('university.id', '==', universityId)
    .get();
}

// 2. Permission checks MUST verify university association  
const checkUniversityAccess = async (userId: string, universityId: string) => {
  const user = await getUser(userId);
  return user.university?.id === universityId;
}

// 3. Role validation for university management
const isUniversityAdmin = (user: User): boolean => {
  return user.role === 'UNIVERSITY_ADMIN';
}

// 4. Error handling with university context
try {
  // University operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`University ${universityId} operation failed:`, error);
  throw new Error(`University operation failed: ${error.message}`);
}

// 5. All university functions must include audit logging
const logUniversityAction = async (action: string, universityId: string, userId: string) => {
  await firestore.collection('auditLogs').add({
    action,
    universityId, 
    userId,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    type: 'UNIVERSITY_MANAGEMENT'
  });
}
```

### **Database Security Rules:**
```javascript
// Firestore security rules for university management
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // University-scoped course access
    match /courses/{courseId} {
      allow read: if resource.data.approvalStatus == 'PUBLISHED' 
                  || (request.auth != null && 
                      get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.university.id == resource.data.university.id);
    }
    
    // Course approval access
    match /courseApprovals/{approvalId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.university.id == resource.data.universityId &&
                         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'UNIVERSITY_ADMIN';
    }
  }
}
```

### **Testing Requirements:**
```typescript
// Each university management feature must include tests for:
describe('University Management', () => {
  test('data isolation between universities', () => {
    // Test that University A cannot access University B data
  });
  
  test('role-based permission enforcement', () => {
    // Test that university instructors cannot access admin functions
  });
  
  test('course approval workflow', () => {
    // Test complete approval workflow from submission to publication
  });
  
  test('university analytics accuracy', () => {
    // Test that analytics calculations are correct and university-scoped
  });
});
```
