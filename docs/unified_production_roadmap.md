# ELIRA Platform - Unified Production Roadmap
## 21-Day Path to 100% Production Readiness

*Last Updated: January 2025*
*Target Launch: Day 21*
*Parallel Work Streams Enabled*

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This unified roadmap merges three development plans (Critical Gaps, User Experience, University Management) into a single, optimized 21-day sprint to production. By identifying dependencies and enabling parallel work streams, we achieve:

- **7-10 days faster** than sequential execution
- **Zero redundant work** through task consolidation  
- **Continuous testing** instead of end-phase validation
- **Progressive feature rollout** for early user feedback
- **100% production readiness** by Day 21

### Success Metrics
- ✅ All critical security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Core user flows functional (enrollment, learning, completion)
- ✅ University management layer operational
- ✅ Payment processing live
- ✅ Performance optimized (<3s load times)
- ✅ GDPR compliant
- ✅ 99.9% uptime capability
