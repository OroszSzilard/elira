## üìù **REPORTING FORMAT REQUEST**

For each audit item above, please provide a response in this format:

```
### [ITEM NUMBER] [ITEM NAME]
**Status:** [‚úÖ Implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚ùå Missing | üö´ Disabled]
**Location:** /path/to/relevant/files

**Notes:** [Additional observations or concerns]
```

## üéØ **PRIORITY FOCUS**

**CRITICAL:** Please prioritize the audit of items 1-3 (Authentication, Payment, Content Management) as these are blocking all platform functionality.

**ANALYSIS DEPTH:** For each item, go deep into the codebase - don't just check if files exist, but analyze if the implementations are complete, working, and production-ready.

**DEPENDENCIES:** Pay special attention to disabled code (like Stripe integrations) and temporary configurations that might indicate incomplete implementations.
