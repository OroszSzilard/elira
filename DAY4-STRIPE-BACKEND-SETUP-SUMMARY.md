# Day 4 Morning: Stripe Backend Setup - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Stripe backend setup for ELIRA as outlined in the Day 4 Morning roadmap. This includes service classes, Cloud Functions, webhook handling, and frontend integration components.

## Files Created

### 1. Stripe Service Layer
**Location**: `/functions/src/services/stripeService.ts`

**Purpose**: Core service class handling all Stripe operations

**Key Features**:
- Customer creation and management
- Checkout session creation for course purchases and subscriptions
- Payment success handling with automatic enrollment
- Subscription management (create, cancel)
- Refund processing
- Payment method management
- Setup intents for saving payment methods

**Methods Implemented**:
- `createOrGetCustomer()` - Creates or retrieves Stripe customer
- `createCheckoutSession()` - Creates Stripe Checkout sessions
- `handlePaymentSuccess()` - Processes successful payments and creates enrollments
- `createEnrollment()` - Creates course enrollments after payment
- `createSubscription()` - Creates subscriptions for recurring billing
- `cancelSubscription()` - Cancels subscriptions with period end
- `createRefund()` - Processes refunds with logging
- `getPaymentMethods()` - Retrieves customer payment methods
- `createSetupIntent()` - Creates setup intents for payment method storage

### 2. Cloud Functions
**Location**: `/functions/src/stripe.ts`

**Purpose**: Firebase Cloud Functions for Stripe operations

**Functions Exported**:
- `createCheckoutSession` - Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- `createCustomer` - Creates or gets Stripe customers
- `createSubscription` - Creates subscriptions
- `cancelSubscription` - Cancels subscriptions
- `createRefund` - Creates refunds (admin only)
- `getPaymentMethods` - Gets user payment methods
- `createSetupIntent` - Creates setup intents
- `getUserSubscriptions` - Gets user subscriptions
- `stripeWebhook` - Handles Stripe webhook events

**Security Features**:
- Authentication required for all functions
- Role-based access control (refunds require admin)
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Webhook Handler
**Location**: Included in `/functions/src/stripe.ts`

**Events Handled**:
- `checkout.session.completed` - Payment success processing
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment confirmation
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failure handling
- `customer.subscription.created/updated` - Subscription state sync
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancellation
- `invoice.payment_succeeded/failed` - Invoice payment tracking

**Features**:
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Automatic Firestore updates
- Email notifications via existing email service
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. Frontend React Hook
**Location**: `/src/hooks/useStripe.ts`

**Purpose**: React hook for Stripe operations in frontend

**Features**:
- TanStack Query integration for caching
- Mutation hooks for all Stripe operations
- Helper functions for common use cases
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Error handling and loading states

**Key Functions**:
- `purchaseCourse()` - One-click course purchase
- `subscribeToPlan()` - Subscription creation
- `cancelSubscriptionWithConfirmation()` - Safe subscription cancellation

### 5. UI Components
**Location**: `/src/components/stripe/`

**Components Created**:

#### StripeCheckoutButton.tsx
- Reusable checkout button component
- Support for both course purchases and subscriptions
- Trust indicators (SSL, payment methods)
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design

#### SubscriptionManager.tsx
- Complete subscription management interface
- Subscription status display with badges
- Cancellation functionality with confirmation
- Payment method management links
- Responsive card layout

## Integration Points

### 1. Firebase Collections
The implementation creates and manages these Firestore collections:
- `checkoutSessions` - Tracks checkout sessions
- `payments` - Payment records with status
- `subscriptions` - Subscription state tracking
- `refunds` - Refund records
- `enrollments` - Course enrollments after payment

### 2. Email Service Integration
- Payment receipt emails via existing `emailService`
- Enrollment confirmation emails
- Subscription status change notifications

### 3. Authentication Integration
- Uses Firebase Auth for user identification
- Integrates with existing user role system
- Supports multi-tenant architecture

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Cloud Functions
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
```

### Firebase Functions Config (Alternative)
```bash
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="sk_..."
firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_..."
```

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation
- Zod schemas for all input validation
- Type safety throughout the stack
- Sanitized database operations

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Auth integration
- Role-based access control
- User ownership verification for operations

### 3. Webhook Security
- Stripe signature verification
- Secure event processing
- Comprehensive error logging

### 4. Data Protection
- No sensitive data in frontend
- Secure customer ID mapping
- Encrypted payment processing

## Testing Considerations

### 1. Stripe Test Mode
- Use Stripe test keys for development
- Test webhook endpoints locally with Stripe CLI
- Validate all payment flows

### 2. Error Scenarios
- Invalid payment methods
- Network failures
- Webhook delivery failures
- Subscription cancellations

### 3. Integration Testing
- End-to-end payment flows
- Email delivery verification
- Enrollment creation verification

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Environment Setup
- Configure Stripe keys in Firebase Functions
- Set up webhook endpoints in Stripe Dashboard
- Configure CORS settings for frontend

### 2. Webhook Configuration
- Set webhook URL: `https://your-region-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`
- Select events to listen for
- Configure webhook signing secret

### 3. DNS & SSL
- Ensure HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Configure proper CORS headers
- Set up domain verification if needed

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Integration
- Add StripeCheckoutButton to course pages
- Integrate SubscriptionManager in user dashboard
- Add payment method management

### 2. Admin Features
- Refund processing interface
- Subscription management tools
- Payment analytics dashboard

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Promo codes and discounts
- Multiple payment methods
